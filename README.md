Hi, Iâ€™m @AllenYoungblood and I'm a software developer, I'm excited too start introducing my personal projects to my github, I look forward to hosing private projects that i use in my daily life as well as projects that i publicly work on with friends and colleagues.

I love home-brewing, Dungeons and dragons, 3D modeling, building software CNC machines, 3D printing, video games, and my dog. I love meshing these passions together to make some really cool products. 

Im a CS grad, Project manager and Software Enginner. I love making projects that improve the world around me and I am a big believer in open source software. Please reach out to me on linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/allenyoungblood if youre interested in working with me. I'm looking forward to learning new skills and helping solve problems

I'm currently open to contract work for rapid prototyping and CAD work. Im a developer professionally and am always interested to make new connections pertaining to that.
