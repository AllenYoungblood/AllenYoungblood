Hi, Iâ€™m @AllenYoungblood and I'm a software developer, up until 2021 my github has been for school projects, but as my skills have grown, I'm excited too start introducing my personal projects to my github, I look forward to hosing private projects that i use in my daily life as well as projects that i publicly work on with friends and colleagues.
I love home brewing, Dungeons and dragons, 3D modeling, and making things that solve real world problems for myself and those around me.

I'm working on learning new technologies like flutter and while reviewing old favorites like java and C/C++. If you want to work on a project together, please send me a message or reach out to me on linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/allenyoungblood . I'm looking forward to learning new skills and helping solve problems
